# DomainMapper
DomainMapper is a parser for hmmscan full output files built centrally around ECOD domain definitions. Other domain definitions are compatible but DomainMapper has been optimized for ECOD. Users can optimize DomainMapper's internal settings with command line flags for use with other domain definitions.
